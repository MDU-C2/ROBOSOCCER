UTP advances kicker
Kicker Force

The weight must be as light as possible.
Approximation: 5m/s using momentum and newtons seconds law.

They have made a spring based kicker. Using hookes law.

Determining the force at a given displacement. with graph.

Speed test.they made a speed test to find the optimal force of the spring.
