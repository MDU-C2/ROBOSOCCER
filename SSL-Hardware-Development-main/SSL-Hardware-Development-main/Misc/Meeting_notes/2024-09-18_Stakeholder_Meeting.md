# Stakeholder meeting 2024-09-18

### How can we validate the system? (Software)
- Write out criterias and then develop tests.
- The validation is up to us how we decide to do that, e.g. the stakeholders are okay with our unit tests passing and that our requirements are met.
    - Functional and non-functional requirements.
    - Make sure the functional requirements are defined and set.

### Hardware prototype focus (Hardware)
- We will focus on developing just 1 prototype and making sure it works before building more robots.
    - Once we get our prototype working we can add order components for more robots to save budget in case of hardware failures.
        - It is sufficinet to just build an additional one or two robots to test the team behaviour.
        - This means have a little bit more budget for each robot, but we should still not buy the most expensive stuff.

### If we want to make any hardware changes (Hardware)
- A discussion channel is created in our group on Canvas, here we will write the *reasons* and other arguments as to why this change is necessary. The stakeholders need to be able to provide this information forward to other partners.
- E.g. we want 4 wheels instead of 3. Create a reply in the Hardware discussion channel and provide a clear list of arguments and reason, ideally accompannied by a pdf document which should tell the same thing.

### How detailed should the design files for PRO1 be? (Hardware & Software)
- There is no minimum requirement for how detailed or what type these should be. It is okay with all the sketches and drawings we have made up until now, e.g. block diagrams for the subsystems, CAD models etc.

### Break down the WBS (Hardware & Software)
- Each deliverable should be 8h < x < 40h. 
    - Break down the subsections more, so that each task is clearly defined.

## For the teamleaders
- Meeting with the colombian students, where we can talk about what they want to do. (If their professor is there they wont talk until he says they can talk).
- Suggestion is that the team leaders have a meeting before were we go through what we want the colombian guys to do.
