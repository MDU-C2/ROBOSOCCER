# Physical Robot Hardware Groups

## 1. Powertrain & Electronics
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Design and implement the power system for the robot, including motors, batteries, and electronic speed controllers (ESCs).
  - Ensure reliable power delivery and efficient energy management.
  - Work on motor control systems and integration with sensors.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Design and optimize the motor control system.
  - Manage battery selection, power distribution, and charging systems.
  - Integrate ESCs, sensors, and other electronics.

## 2. Mechanical Design & Actuation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Design the mechanical structure of the robot, focusing on the chassis, actuators, and movement systems (e.g., wheels, kicker).
  - Ensure the robot's agility, durability, and compliance with SSL requirements.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Develop mechanical systems such as the drivetrain (motors, gears, wheels).
  - Design and implement actuation systems for the kicker, roller, and other movement mechanisms.
  - Ensure that mechanical components are robust and reliable.

## 3. 3D CAD & Body Design
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create detailed 3D models of the robot's structure and components.
  - Focus on optimizing the robot's size, weight, and overall design to meet RoboCup SSL regulations.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Develop 3D CAD models for the robot body, including the chassis and outer casing.
  - Collaborate with the mechanical group to ensure designs are manufacturable.
  - Design parts for 3D printing.

## 4. Sensors & Embedded Systems
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Integrate sensors (e.g., cameras, distance sensors) and develop embedded systems for real-time data processing.
  - Focus on the interaction between hardware components and real-world data (e.g., ball tracking, robot positioning).
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Select and integrate sensors into the robot for object detection, localization, and feedback.
  - Develop firmware and embedded systems for real-time sensor processing.
  - Ensure smooth communication between sensors and the robot's main control systems.
