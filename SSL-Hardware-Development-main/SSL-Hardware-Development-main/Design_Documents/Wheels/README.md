## Wheels from Participants 2024
- In all the papers reviewed from 2024, 4 omni wheels are consistently used. 
- 3D-printed wheels made from PLA did not hold up. 
- The wheel size depends on the weight of the robot. 
- Bigger wheels can make the robot faster, but the extra weight slows it down by requiring more energy to move.
- More rollers resulted in a smoother motion and more contact with the ground. 
## Team that switched from 3 to 4 wheels
- Some teams initially used 3 wheels but later switched to 4, without giving a specific reason for the change.
