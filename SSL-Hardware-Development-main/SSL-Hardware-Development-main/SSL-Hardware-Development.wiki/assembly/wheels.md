### Assembly Instructions
Step-by-step instructions for assembling the wheel. Recommended tools: Tweezers, cylindrical base.

2. Place a wheel back onto a cylindrical base with clearance for the sub wheel slots.

3. Thread the bearing onto the steel pin.

4. Place the X-ring onto the bearing.

5. Place 1 nylon washer on each side of the X-ring.

6. Carefully place the subwheel assembly into one of the slots, ensuring that the washers stay in line with the X-ring.

7. Repeat this process for all 20 subwheels. This needs to be done methodically so the already placed sub wheels don't fall off, since there is nothing keeping them in place.
8. Once all 20 sub wheels are in place, line up the holes of the wheel front with the holes of the wheel back, and press into place. There will probably be resistance from the nylon washers, so gently push on the washers from the side until the front and back can be pushed together.
9. While holding onto the wheel to keep them together, screw the wheel together with the hub to ensure that the sub wheels are securely in place.

### Assembly Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for assembling the wheel. Needed tools: depending on the screw, we use torx.

1. Items:

2. Place the lagerblock so that the holes line up with the motor holes.

4. Place the pillowblock on top of the lagerbock.
![PXL_20241213_122947691](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/988e887d-92d1-4ad1-896a-e69a3651da4e)

5. Take the motor and pillowblock and place it in it's location on top of the bottom plate. Then slide the wheel onto the motor axis.
![PXL_20241213_123122866](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ca381ce-dd7e-404a-9677-0dfd59d99ed3)

6. Screw the lagerbock loosely into place. Don't fasten the pillow block.
![PXL_20241213_123301857](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a974e0f-8078-4a7d-b787-8001b4e0f32f)

7. Before tightening the pillow block in place, make sure the wheel is fully on the motor axis and then tighten the hub screws to ensure that the wheels stay on.

8. The pillow block can now be fastened and the lagerbock screws can also be fully fastened.
