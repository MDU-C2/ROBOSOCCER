# Functional Requirements
The functional requirements define the end product and what is expected to be delivered for the working product.

1. [ ] The robot must fit within the 180mm diameter, imposed by SSL rules.
2. [ ] The chassis should be lightweight.
3. [ ] Designed with modularity in mind for easy maintenance.
4. [ ] The robot should use four/three-wheel omni-wheels for fast movement in any direction.
5. [ ] Brushless DC motors (BLDC) with high torque to enable fast acceleration.
6. [ ] Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) to control the BLDC motors with feedback for speed and direction control.
7. [ ] The robot must be able to consistently kick the ball.
8. [ ] A dribbler system for ball control.
9. [ ] Sensors to detect the ball relative to the robot.
10. [ ] Wheel encoders and IMUs for feedback on the robots orientation and speed.
11. [ ] Proximity sensors to avoid collisions with other robots.
12. [ ] Battery management system that powers the motors, sensors, and electronics for the duration of the SSL game time.
13. [ ] Power distribution system for stable power delivery to motors, controllers and other components during high loads.
14. [ ] A real-time processing unit capable of processing sensor data, controlling the actuators, and executing commands.
