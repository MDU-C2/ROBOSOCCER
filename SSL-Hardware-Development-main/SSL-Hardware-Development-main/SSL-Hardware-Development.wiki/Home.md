## Introduction
Welcome to the wiki page for the course in DVA490. This years iteration of the project focused on developing an omnidirectional robot. This wiki page will serve as documentation for our robot, the hardware used and how it is assembled streamlining the integration for future improvements of the compoenents. 
The robot consist of 4 omnidirectional wheels, 4 BLDC motors and 1 BLDC motor for the dribbler, a kicker and a mainboard for powering the electronics. 

## System Overview
<!--Describe the system architecture, main features, and working principles.-->
The heart of the robot is the [NUCLEO-H723ZG](https://github.com/DVA490-474-Project-Course/SSL-Hardware-Development/wiki/Microcontroller), it controls the data sampled from the sensors, calculate the kinematics and much more through a middleware called micro-ROS.

<!--## Components-->
<!--See **[BOM](https://github.com/DVA490-474-Project-Course/SSL-Hardware-Development/tree/new_structure/BOM)** for a full list of components.-->

## Schematics & Diagrams
Include diagrams for electrical circuits, mechanical layout, and connectivity.

## Assembly Instructions
The assembly section describes how to assemble the components. The assembly instructions for the [wheels](https://github.com/DVA490-474-Project-Course/SSL-Hardware-Development/wiki/wheels), [Dribbler](https://github.com/DVA490-474-Project-Course/SSL-Hardware-Development/wiki/dribbler) and [Kicker](https://github.com/DVA490-474-Project-Course/SSL-Hardware-Development/wiki/kicker) can be found in the sidebar.
